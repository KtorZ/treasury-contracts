//  - To prevent someone from spending existing funds controlled by the contract, `account` must not occur in the inputs
//  - To allow subtle issues around minUTxO, the funds locked at `account` must be *at least* the amount withdrawn
//  - The funds can be split across multiple UTxOs for organizational purposes
